                Vazaar started with a group of Emory students who struggled with <b>2nd hand selling</b> system in Emory community. 
                Need to sell your couch quickly or purchase a new dining table? Look no further - Vazaar exists to help college students <b>save money and easily find necessary products</b> needed in college by building a safe marketplace. <b>Platforms such as Vezzy and Facebook Marketplace may lead to further headaches due to the clutter of products without categories and simplicity. </b>
                Vazaar aims to solve this very issue with a <b>focus on furniture</b>, as it is among the most necessary items to buy and sell when moving in and out of off-campus housing.

                Students who move off-campus seek furniture for their new living space. However, there exists several obstacles: high costs, lack of personal vehicle, and uncertainty on what to do with the furniture upon graduation. Thus, most students find it cost-efficient to purchase used furniture. 
                Vazaar brings these considerations all together: <b>a user-friendly platform where sellers can easily list their used furniture in a categorized and organized manner while providing simplicity for buyers</b> in purchasing exactly what they are seeking.
